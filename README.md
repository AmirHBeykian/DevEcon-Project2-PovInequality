# DevEcon-Project2-PovertyInequality
Hi!

This project is rendered using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

The source code file is `main.qmd`, located in the root directory. To view the
report, please clone the entire repository and open `Report/main.html` in a web
browser.

If you prefer to run the code without installing Quarto, you can execute the
`main_r.rmd` file, which contains the exact same code chunks. Please ensure that
the data files are located in the `Data` folder so that the code chunks can run
successfully.
